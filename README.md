# nohello

**nohello** is a simple web project that encourages more efficient and direct communication, particularly in chat environments. It highlights the unnecessary practice of just saying "Hello" in a conversation without immediately getting to the point.
This is a fork from  <a href="https://github.com/nohello-net/site">nohello.net</a>.
This repository contains a multi-language version of the website, where users can choose their preferred language for an improved experience.

## üí° Description

The **nohello** project aims to encourage users to avoid unnecessary pleasantries such as "Hello" before asking a question. While these greetings are meant to be polite, they often result in wasted time and decreased productivity in fast-paced environments like chat.

### Why this project?

Imagine calling someone on the phone and saying, "Hello!" then immediately putting them on hold. Wouldn't it be more efficient to just get to the point right away? This project raises awareness about that behavior and offers better alternatives for efficient communication.
